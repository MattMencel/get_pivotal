This is ugly.  I hacked it together so I could generate some HTML reports from Pivotal Tracker.

We have lots of projects going on at once and the Pivotal Tracker site does not have a good way to show all the stories one person has going in all their projects.  

This script creates a summary file called "projects.html" for the "project manager" so they can see the big picture.  It also generates individual "Joe Smith.html" files for the individuals who own stories.


TODO:
- make it less ugly
- generate emails to the individuals
- generate the HTML more nicely
- ?????
